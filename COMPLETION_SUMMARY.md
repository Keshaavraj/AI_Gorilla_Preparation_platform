## 💡 Study Strategy

### For Best Results:

1. **Start with Familiar Topics** (Build Confidence)
   - Begin with categories you know well
   - Aim for 80%+ accuracy before moving on

2. **Progressive Learning**
   - Core AI/ML → Frameworks → Libraries → Programming → Cognitive Skills
   - Or focus on your weakest areas first

3. **Practice Regularly**
   - 30-60 minutes daily is better than long cramming sessions
   - Consistency is key

4. **Review Explanations Carefully**
   - Read explanations even when you get answers correct
   - Understand the "why" not just the "what"

5. **Track Your Progress**
   - Use the analytics dashboard
   - Identify weak categories and focus on them
   - Retry categories until you achieve 80%+

6. **Use Time Estimates**
   - Practice under test conditions
   - TestGorilla tests are timed, so practice accordingly

---
