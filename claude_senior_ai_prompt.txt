ACT AS: A Lead AI Solutions Architect at a Tier-1 Tech Company (OpenAI, NVIDIA, or Meta).
TASK: Generate a high-fidelity bank of at least 20 MUST-KNOW interview questions for Senior AI/ML Engineers.

TOPICS TO COVER (Distribute 2-3 questions per cluster):
1. DATA OPS: NumPy (Strides/Broadcasting), Pandas (Memory/Vectorization/Chunking).
2. MODEL ARCHITECTURE: PyTorch/TF (DDP, Autograd, Custom Layers), Transformers (Attention scaling, Flash Attention).
3. GEN AI & NLP: Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA), Quantization (GPTQ/AWQ), Tokenization (BPE), Alignment (DPO/RLHF).
4. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: OOP (Design Patterns for ML), Algorithms (Space complexity of Tensors), REST APIs (Throughput vs Latency).
5. INFRA & DEVOPS: Docker (GPU passthrough, multi-stage builds), Kubernetes (shm-size, resource limits), Security (OWASP for LLMs, Prompt Injection).

QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
- LEVEL: Expert/Senior (Assume 5+ years experience).
- FORMAT: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) with 4 options (A, B, C, D).
- DISTRACTORS: One option must be a "Junior Trap" (the obvious but inefficient answer).
- EXPLANATION: Detailed technical reasoning. Mention memory (VRAM), computational complexity (FLOPs), or production trade-offs.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Q[Number]: [The Scenario-based Question]
A) [Option]
B) [Option]
C) [Option]
D) [Option]
Correct: [Letter]
Senior Explanation: [Deep-dive into why this is the optimal production choice compared to others.]

GENERATE 20 QUESTIONS each sub level topics.
already you have existing qna available in this project direcotry which you can keep as it is, you create all these in another page.
